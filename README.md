# 🖐️ Gesture-Controlled AI – Self Learning Project

> Real-time gesture control system built with **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe**, and **pyautogui**  
> _Originally started as a self-learning project by Vaishali Limje — now a functional, feature-rich automation toolkit!_

---

## 🔍 Project Goal

Build a system that detects hand gestures via webcam and maps them to real-world computer actions like:
- Swiping slides
- Taking screenshots
- Pausing/playing videos
- Switching tabs/windows
- Moving cursor
- **Clicking with pinch gesture**

---

## ✅ Features

- ✅ Real-time hand tracking with MediaPipe
- ✅ Finger gesture detection (UP/DOWN status)
- ✅ Smoothed cursor control via fingertip
- ✅ **Pinch-to-click** mouse simulation
- ✅ Screenshot trigger with gesture-hold
- ✅ Swipe left/right gesture for tab switching
- ✅ Clean modular Python scripts for each phase
- ✅ Code committed daily with GitHub history

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- Git & GitHub

## 📚 Author's Note

> This project is part of my hands-on AI learning journey. Every phase was built from scratch — no tutorials, no shortcuts.  
> It helped me master OpenCV, gesture logic, and real-time input handling in Python.  
>  
> I’m sharing it openly to inspire other learners and showcase how solo projects can become practical tools.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Scroll gesture simulation  
- Gesture-based drag and drop  
- Volume control  
- Integration with browser or media apps  
- Voice feedback using TTS
